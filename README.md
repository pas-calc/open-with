# open-with
provides "open with" helpers for Linux systems

in your file explorer (e.g. nemo) right click on a file and select "open with", then choose the appropriate program, so that it will be set for handling these file types (either by mime type or by extension)

The associations can be looked up unter:
* ```~/.local/share/applications```
* ```~/.config/mimeapps.list```

or the corresponding system-wide settings
